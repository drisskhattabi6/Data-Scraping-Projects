# Data Scraping Tasks

Welcome to the **Data Scraping Tasks** repository! This repository showcases my data scraping Tasks, where I have used Python and various libraries (like `BeautifulSoup`, `Scrapy`, and `Requests`) to extract, process, and analyze data from the web. Each project is stored in its respective folder with detailed explanations, code, and datasets.
