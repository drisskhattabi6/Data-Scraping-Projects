## Introduction

In this project, we'll build a web scraper to extract job listings from a popular job search platform. We'll extract job titles, companies, locations, job descriptions, and other relevant information.

Here are the main steps we'll follow in this project:

1. Write the Python code to extract job data from our job search platform
2. Save the data to a CSV file


## Prerequisites

you need to create Scrapfly account to get API key, and you will use the following packages in your Python environment:

- scrapfly-sdk
- BeautifulSoup
- csv
- markdownify
- pandas

you can install additional packages using `!pip install packagename` :

- `!pip install scrapfly-sdk`
- `!pip install BeautifulSoup`
- `!pip install pandas`
- `!pip install markdownify`

## Note : 
You can search for any job in any country by entering the values of those variables :  `job_title` and `country`.
